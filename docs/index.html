                  <p>In recent days the International Organization for migration (IOM) have released their latest World Migration Report. According to the report, migrants make up about 3.5 of the global population, which is about 7.7 billion people out of 272 million migrants to another countries. The United States remains the largest destination country, followed by Germany, Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Kingdom. </p>
                  <p>If you are considering to migrant to another country in the near future. Then this project is going to answer some of the most common immigration questions to accommodate your interest. We will break it down into five categories with interactive data to present you with the most appropriate information. Also, we will have a custom rank between the top seven countries that we think is the most suitable for immigration ranging from all the continent and climate. We believe that we can have insightful recommendations for all the concerns you have. Please take your time and play with our slides.</p>

              <p><strong>Let’s start by exploring some of the basic demogrhic information of the selected countries.</strong> Depending on your field of interest you might choose to migrant to country with more more diversify ethnicity, or perhaps you are more interested in countries where population ageing is less severe. But nevertheless, United States have the largest number of populations of 32 million people, followed by Brazil and Japan. On the other hand, there are about 29% of population of Japan are 65 years or older while some developing counties such as Philippines on have 5%.</p>
              <p>The Following visualization display insightful information regards to the demographic information of the country of your interest.</p>

              <p>Now we look at the labor marker in those seven countries. Due to the differnet economic structure, social background and natural environment, there are many differences exsit in those countries.</p>

              <h3 id="unemployment-rate">Unemployment Rate</h3><p>We can first focus on the unemployment rate, which is one aspect which many people care about. We can see from the graph that South Africa has the highest unemployment rate, which is above 25% for both genders. And Brazil has the second highest unemployment rate above 10% for both genders. If you need to find a job in the target country, we recommand countries other than South Africa and Brazil.</p>

              <h3 id="average-annual-income">Average Annual Income</h3>
              <p>What’s more, we can take a look at the average annual income in each country. We can see Germany has avarge annual income exceed 50k and Australia exceed 40k. Income is an important feature representing the living quality, especially when measuring whether people can live decently.</p>

              <h3 id="distribution-of-different-industries">Distribution of Different Industries</h3>
              <p>We can also take a step into the distribution of the three major industries: agriculture, industry and services. These are the three traditional area in the labor market. And we can see services takes the largest portion among all countres. However, if you prefer to work in the area of agriculture, Philippines and Brazil are good choices. And if industry looks good to you, then you can take Japan and Germany into consideration.</p>

            <h2 id="q3:-what-about-the-welfare?">Q<!-- -->3<!-- -->: What about the welfare?</h2>
            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <p>To assess the welfare, we’d like to catch a glimpse of indicators in two aspects, basically the health system and the tax rate.</p>

            <h3 id="overall-health-system-performance">Overall Health System Performance</h3>
            <p>According to a paper published from World Health Organization (WHO), we have scores and rankings of the 119 countries all over the world. 1.00 is set as the full mark and the countries are ranked by their scores in descending order. Japan, Germany, Australia and United States are among the top 40 and should be the ideal choices.

            <h3 id="health-expenditure">Health Expenditure</h3>
            <p>Health expenditure plays an important role in health system evaluation. We have three indicators concerning the health expenditure.</p>

            <h3 id="health-insurance">Health Insurance</h3>
            <p>Health insurance is an essential make-up of health system that it provides financial protection in case people have a serious accident or illness. We provide the coverage of health insurance collected by ILO in 2014.</p>

            <h3 id="tax">Tax</h3><p>People pay taxes to fund a variety of federal, state, and local services. Half of Americans’ tax burden is for federal programs. However, taxes can also eat up a considerable portion of people’s salary. We have tax rate in three dimensions to give a sense of how much tax you should pay.</p>

            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <p>The environment is a critical factor regarding the livability of the country. People want to have fresh air and have the ability to see green everywhere. We will assess this by looking at the forest area and the CO2 emission of the country. Also, we will demonstrate the overall development of the people in the country by three factors: HDI, Prison Rate, and College Education.</p>

            <h4 id="human-develpment-index"> Human Developement Index</h4>
            <p>HDI assess the health knowledge and the standard living of a country. We are going to show the global ranking and the HDI level, respectively.</p>
