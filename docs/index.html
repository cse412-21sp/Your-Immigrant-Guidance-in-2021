Do you know that internationally there is about 3.5 percent of the global population migrating to another country? Out of 7.7 billion people, there were 272 million migrants. The United States remains the largest destination country, followed by Germany, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Yet, the data is still showing an upward trend of about 3% growth every five years since 1990. It has become a global phenomenon where people migrate to another country for adventure or a better life. The data collected for this project are the latest data source available</p></div><div class="col-6"><img src="img/imgration.jpeg"/></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/PopulationGrowthRate_16230972572560/Sheet1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="mt-3"><p>Suppose you are interested in emigrating to another country. In that case, we believe that this project will assist you in exploring some of the important criteria that you might consider regarding migration. For your convenience, We will break it down into five categories with interactive data to present you with the most appropriate information ranging from demographics, labor market, welfare, environment, to education. To accommodate different diversity, we picked <span class="annotated-text">seven countries<span class="annotation-text">Japan, Germany, Australia, South Africa, Philippines, United States, Brazil</span></span> that are the best to immigrate to worldwide.</p></div><h1 id="section-1:-what-about-the-demographic?">Section <!-- -->1<!-- -->: What about the Demographic?</h1><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><p><strong>Let’s start by exploring some of the basic demographic information of the selected countries,</strong> depending on your field of interest, you might choose to migrate to a country with diverse ethnicity,  or perhaps you are more interested in countries 	where people live longer. On the right, there will be a table that provides some of the basic demographic information for you to explore; click on the country to see data specific to that country.</p></div><div class="col-12"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/demographic_Info/Dashboard1?:language=zh-CN&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="population">Population</h3><p>The United States has the largest population of 32 million people, followed by Brazil and Japan. Notice that even though the landmass of Australia is 20 times more than that of Japan, its population is only one-fifth of Japan. If you enjoy living in a less crowded country, then Australia would be a perfect choice.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/pop_16231091275990/Sheet8?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="age-distribution">Age Distribution</h3><p><p>The age distribution of a country determines the size of the labor market. The majority of the population in all countries is of the working-age, while population aging is severe in some countries. For example, in Japan, almost 30 percent of the population is 65 years or older, while in South Africa, the number is only 0.09 percent. At the same time, the following visualization displays some critical information about the age distribution of each country. In the end, too many older people will cause a deficit in government spending since they don’t have enough people to pay tax while the government has to spend more on welfare.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/p2_16225232555920/Dashboard4?:language=en-US&amp;amp;:display_count=n&amp;amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe> </p></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="race-&amp;-ethnicity">Race &amp; Ethnicity</h3><p>You can now click on the list of countries to explore their distribution of race and ethnicity on the left of the visualization below. Out of the countries available, Japan has a very homogeneous ethnicity distribution where most people are Japanese. On the other hand, Australia has a very diverse population, with most of them being English.  However, most countries are dominated by one race, either Asian, European, African, or Hispanic. Diversity is also the reason why each region has its unique, splendid culture.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/race_16231061047150/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe></div></div></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><h1 id="section-2:-is-the-labor-market-looks-promising?">Section <!-- -->2<!-- -->: Is the labor market looks promising?</h1><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><p><strong>Since not every immigrant can afford to live without working, it is crucial to look at the labor market in the designated country.</strong> We will analyze the working force with different economic structures and social backgrounds by focusing on the unemployment rate, average income, and industry distribution to help you build your career in a foreign country.</p></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="unemployment-rate">Unemployment Rate</h3><p>Since the unemployment rate directly dictates the likelihood of getting a job, we must look at it carefully. South Africa has a whopping 26 percent unemployment rate out of all the available countries, followed by Brazil; you will need to be extra prepared if you are looking to get a job in either country. Such a high unemployment rate is due to the concentration of labor in the metropolitan area. When there are more people than jobs available, you will have a higher unemployment rate.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/unemployment_Rate/Sheet4?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="90%" height="400"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="average-annual-income">Average Annual Income</h3><p>On the other hand, the average annual income is directly related to your daily life quality. With a higher income, you will more likely have a more comfortable life, where Australia and Germany both exceed forty thousand dollars. Thus, Australia and Germany will be a better choice if you wish to have more freedom on money.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Average_income/Sheet2?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="80%" height="400"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="distribution-of-different-industries">Distribution of Different Industries</h3><p>There are Agriculture, Industry, and Service in the traditional areas of the labor market. With the service industry contributing significantly to the domestic and global economy, services usually take the most significant portion among different countries. However, if you are looking for a job in the agriculture sector, then the Philippines and Brazil are your best choice since they have a more significant proportion. Finally, Japan and Germany have a very high degree of industrialization; if you are an engineer, you should consider both countries if you choose to work in the industry.</p></div></div></div><div class="fullwidth"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/distribution_industry/Sheet1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="450"></iframe></div><div class="mt-3 row"><p><strong>Bring it all together.</strong> So far, we have a look at the performance of the labor markets independently. We think Germany, Australia, and Japan are performing the best in this section through a more comprehensive analysis. Although the Philippines has a similar unemployment rate as Germany, the average annual income is only one-tenth of Germany, making it less desirable to immigrate to if you care about the quality of life. Next, we will inspect the welfare of a country.</p></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><h1 id="section-3:-what-about-the-welfare?">Section <!-- -->3<!-- -->: What about the welfare?</h1><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><p><strong>While income largely accounts for the best living quality possible in a country, welfare accounts for the worst living quality one can have.</strong> Social welfare plays an essential role in reducing socio-economic inequalities and protecting people from various hardships crucial in catalyzing society’s prosperity. This section will focus on a country’s overall health performance, the number of health expenditures, and health insurance.</p></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="overall-health-system-performance">Overall Health System Performance</h3><p>To overview the health system performance, we will use the scoring system from WHO(World Health Organization). The scoring system measured 191 countries worldwide based on five indicators: population health level, health inequalities, health system responsiveness, distribution of responsiveness, and distribution of health expenditure. Based on WHO, Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United States are the top 4 among the seven, and they are also top 40 worldwide. Ideally, Australia, Germany, Japan, and the United States are countries with more advanced health systems.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/ScoresofOverallHealthSystemPerfromance/ScoresofOverallHealthSystemPerformance?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="80%" height="400"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="health-expenditure">Health Expenditure</h3><p>Naturally, a higher overall health performance ranking indicates that the government invests more money in the health system. Since Health is a vital issue throughout one’s life, higher healthcare expenditure usually means the better provision of health opportunities.  However, the cost of health care should also be taken into consideration. Even though the United States spends significantly more money on its health system than the others, the citizen is also paying more money to enjoy the health care. The higher cost offsets the expenditure, making the United States only rank 37, which is behind Japan which ranks 10.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/ScoresofOverallHealthSystemPerfromance/healthexpenditure1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="80%" height="400"></iframe><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/ScoresofOverallHealthSystemPerfromance/healthexpenditure2?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="80%" height="500"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="may-the-tax-be-with-you">May the Tax be with You</h3><p>While people enjoy the welfare that the government provides, it is also their responsibility to pay taxes to fund everything from local services to ensuring national securities. Half of Americans’ tax burden is for federal programs. However, taxes can also consume a considerable portion of people’s salaries. There are three main types of taxes that we focus on in the visualization. The tax types on the button right allow you to view between Social security tax rates for employees/ employers and the income tax. Overall, Japan and Germany have the top 3 highest tax rates in all three dimensions. If you aren’t willing to bear too much burden from your income tax and social security tax, you should choose other countries than Japan and Germany.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/NTCSQ28M9?:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="80%" height="400"></iframe></div></div></div><div class="mt-3"><p><strong>Overall, there seems to be a correlation between tax rate and health care performance.</strong> Since the government has more money to spend, the country will likely receive more benefits regarding health care; this is why Japan is ranked highest out of the seven countries for both WHO score and tax rate.

Also, people might care about the general education of the people and determine whether the country is pleasing. Here you will see several visualizations regarding the wellness of the people and the environment.</p><h3 id="human-developement-index">Human Developement Index</h3></div><div class="col-6"><p>The human development index represents a comprehensive check on people’s life expectancy, education, and per capita income to measure human development. Based on each country’s rank, you will have a better idea of which country is more developed, thus having better life quality. Out of 189 countries in the human development index ranking, Germany by far ranked the highest, followed by Australia. The two countries are the most developed of the seven countries we picked. It is usually true that people will have good manners and be more respectful.</p></div><div class="col-6"><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/HDI_ranking/HumanDevelopeindexsglobalranking?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="320"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="prison-rate">Prison Rate</h3><p>The incarceration rate, in some sense, could reflect the stability of the society, which indicates a safer environment to live in. When people are away from their hometown, and everything is unfamiliar, safety should be an essential factor regarding residing in another country. Japan has the lowest prison rate with merely 30 people for every 100000 people. Finally, if safety is mainly concerned with, then Japan and Germany would be a priority consideration.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/PrisonRate_16230986734830/Sheet1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="300"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="forest-area">Forest Area</h3><p>After we check the wellness of the citizens, we can inspect the quality of the environment. As a percentage of landmass, the forest area determines how much <strong>green</strong> you will have in everyday life. If you are fond of nature, you might want to be in a country with a higher forest-to-land ratio where people have more opportunities to walk in the park and visit the zoo. Moreover, the forest can absorb CO2, which provides cleaner air in general. Nevertheless, despite the landmass of Japan, its forests are as high as 68% in 2018, making it preferable for people who like nature.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Forest_area_16230996007690/Forestareaaspercentageoflandarea?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="500"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="co2-emission-rate">CO<!-- -->2 <!-- -->Emission rate</h3><p>On the other hand, while forests can absorb CO2, greenhouse gas emissions are the culprit for global warming. As a member of the earth, it should be everyone’s responsibility to minimize their CO2 emission to provide a better environment for our descendants. The lower CO2 level can make the Greenhouse gas level lower, which makes a better world. More industrialized countries are inevitable with higher CO2 emission rates; it explains why Japan and Germany have a significantly higher CO2 emission rate than the Philippines. Also, Japan and Germany perform much better than the United States and Australia; they emit 40 percent less CO2 when having such a high HDI ranking, showing that they have a high standard on protecting the environment.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/CarbonDioxide_16231000870730/Carbondioxide?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="heritage-sites">Heritage Sites</h3><p>The UNESCO world heritage sites are an excellent way to reveal the rich culture of a country. More heritage sites will give people more opportunities to explore the mystery of the country’s past. Such an adventure will provide you with the chance to know the country and its culture better. Germany has the most heritage sites as a traveler and immigrant, which makes it optimal for visiting. Also, you can view all the UNESCO heritage by clicking on the country. It will bring you to the UNESCO official websites, which give you all the information you need.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/heritage_16231004198960/Heritagesitecounts?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe></div></div></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><h1 id="section-5:-i-want-a-kids,-will-the-kid-live-well?">Section <!-- -->5<!-- -->: I want a Kids, Will the kid live well?</h1><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-12"><p><strong>Raising kids is a <strong>pleasant and meaningful</strong> <!-- -->event in one’s life.</strong> We use kids mortality rate, education, and adult social engagement to illustrate three important stages to determine whether the candidate countries are suitable for raising kids. </p></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="under-five-mortality-rate">Under Five Mortality Rate</h3><p>Kids are <strong>vulnerable</strong> when they are under five. The mortality rate under five indicates how the infrastructure supports the first five years of kids. In the previous sections, we discussed healthcare and discovered that developing countries have poor health system performance. To some extent, this also reflects on the child mortality rate where we can see that Brazil and South Africa are having such a high mortality rate with an incomplete health care system.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/mortality_16231013197750/Sheet1?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="300"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="education">Education</h3><p>Education is essential for children’s <strong>mental and physical development</strong>. The ratio between the enrolled student and the population within the suitable education ages is the gross enrollment rate. Here we divided education into three sections where the primary and secondary focus on the children’s early education. Tertiary education is the college rate that focuses on the higher education of individuals; as you can see, Australia is performing relatively well in all three categories, ensuring that children could be well educated if you choose to live here. </p><p>Note that there is a slider on the bottom right of the visualization that you could explore the three stages of education enrollment rate by sex for all seven countries. Click on the slider and explore the stage that you are interested in.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/education-2/Sheet2?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="80%" height="500"></iframe></div><div class="col-12"><h3 id="neet">NEET</h3><p>NEET(Not in Education, Employment, or Training indicate what is the general) provides an index of how teenagers are involved in social engagement after 18, including continuous education, employment, and training.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/NEET_16231010870100/Sheet3?:language=en-US&amp;:display_count=n&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="450"></iframe></div></div><div class="mt-3 row"><p><strong>With these data about children’s development, we can get a great sense of how children are grown in the candidate countries.</strong> But raising children requires much more than what we have shown in this section.

But immigration is a long-lasting topic in our society, and it is hard to include every possible detail in our project. Thus, the five sections that we have included in this project are just a glance at some of the angles to consider when making such an important decision. We hope that this project will give you more insight into whether you should immigrate and where to immigrate.</p><h3 id="data-source">Data Source</h3><ul><li><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a></li><li><a href="https://data.un.org/">United Nations</a></li><li><a href="https://data.unicef.org/">United Nations Children’s Emergency Fund</a></li><li><a href="https://www.who.int/">World Health Organization</a></li><li><a href="https://www.oecd.org/">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development</a></li><li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/">Our world in data</a></li><li><a href="https://en.unesco.org/">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a></li><li><a href="https://www.undp.org/">United Nations Development Programme</a></li><li><a href="https://www.prisonstudies.org/">World Prison Brief</a></li></ul><h2 id="about-us">About US</h2><p>This project is created by Kenny Mai, Mike Huang, Benjamin Jing, Weiqiaao Shen, and Siyue Zhu for the course CSE412: Data Visualization in the University of Washingtoon.</p><p>Special thanks to professor: <strong>Jane Hoffswell</strong>, and teaching assistants: <strong>Aayush Chhaabra</strong>, <strong>Dalton Hildreth</strong>, <strong>Kalyani Marathe</strong>, <strong>Yue Zhang</strong>, and <strong>Yueqian Zhang</strong>.</p></div></div></div></div>
